Tips for running DosFlash on Windows 7
----------------------------------------

Since Windows Vista 64 Bit and upwards it is necessary that every driver is signed. Because
the DosFlash driver will not be signed by MS due to some unknown reason we need to cicumvent
this check. You have the following 2 possibilities to do this.

Safe Way of Disabling Driver Signature Enforcement
1) On Windows 7 bootup press F8 to get to the extended boot options screen
2) Choose "Disable Driver Signature Enforcement"
3) To start DosFlash right click on it in Windows Explorer and choose
   "Run as administrator" > answer the message box with "Yes"
4) Short after the program started a "Program Compatibility Assistant" warning message
   is displayed, you can simply ignore this by pressing the "Close" button

Recommended Way of Disabling Driver Signature Enforcement
1) Disable User Account Control (UAC)
   - go to "Start Menu" > "Control Panel" > "User Accounts and Family Safety" > "User Accounts"
   - click on "Change User Account Control settings"
   - set the slider bar to the lowest value (Never notify) > click "OK"
2) Sign the DosFlash driver
   - download the "Driver Signature Enforcement Overrider" (DSEO) from
     http://www.ngohq.com/home.php?page=dseo
   - start DSEO > click "Next" > "Yes" > choose "Sign a System File" > "Next" > enter the path to
     the used driver (portio32.sys or portio64.sys) > "OK" > "OK"
3) Disable Driver Signature Enforcement
   - start DSEO > click "Next" > "Yes" > choose "Enable Test Mode" > "Next" > "OK"
4) Restart the computer

Keep in mind that with the recommended way the changes will have effect on every reboot without
doing anything manual. The first way needs to be done over and over again. In addition the second
way can be used to sign every driver that doesn't run natively on Windows 7.

For use of the VIA Cards in Windows 7 it is recommended to uninstall the VIA driver. This can be
done like follows:
- start "Device Manager" > expand "Storage controllers" > right click on "VIA RAID Controller" > 
  choose "Uninstall" > "OK"
- rename C:\Windows\inf\vsmraid.inf to vsmraid.inf_
- rename C:\Windows\inf\vsmraid.PNF to vsmraid.PNF_
- rename C:\Windows\System32\drivers\vsmraid.sys to vsmraid.sys_
- reboot computer
